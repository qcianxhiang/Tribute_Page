        <ul>
          <li><span class="boldP">3rd century BC to the 14th century BC</span> - The elements, symbols, and symbolic meanings in the tarot cards are a self-contained and rigorous divination system that integrates multi-national occultism, Christianity, Judaism, Egyptian mythology, constellations, digital symbols, and symbolism.</li>
          <li><span class="boldP">10th to 17th century</span> - In Europe, where Catholics are the majority, due to the conservative atmosphere of religion and the prohibition of divination by the Christian system, Tarot gradually abandoned the original form of divination - serving the function of card games for a long time, until it finally transformed into the poker that is now common.</li>
          <li><span class="boldP">late 18th century</span> - Tarot cards not only use European folk interpretation methods, but mystics make tarot cards more "scientific and standardized", evolving from divination in the form of primitive folklore to occult divination that can independently develop a set of theories. Tarot cards used for divination can only be kept in secret societies.</li>
          <li><span class="boldP">19th century</span> - In English-speaking countries, because of the development of democracy and freedom of speech, tarot games have become popular.</li>
          <li><span class="boldP">21st century</span> - Tarot cards developed rapidly in non-English-speaking countries (especially influenced by the United States), and tarot cards in English-speaking countries were transformed into all divination purposes, and this marketing model quickly returned to Europe and Asia. Tarot cards in China, Japan, Singapore and other places have also become a very popular divination.</li>
        </ul>
